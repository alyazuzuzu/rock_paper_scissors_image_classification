# Rock, paper, and scissors image classification project.
This project is my final project in Dicoding class "Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula". I made an artificial neural network using TensorFlow to predict whether it is a rock, paper, or scissors image. I use Callback to prevent overfitting and for model evaluation, I plotted a loss and accuracy of each training and validation. 
This model can predict the image with 98% accuracy.
